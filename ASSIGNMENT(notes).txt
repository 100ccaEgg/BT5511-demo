github.org --> public repository for code (new programmes and software for the codes)

- github reporitory tracks the changes of teh document that has been tracked

-only thing to add to github will be the code (no need to add any other files (images and so on)

-assignment: 1000-1500 word assignment where we act as a nioinformation that is reccomending the focus of 5 genes 
	- one of them has to have 3 components in it 

Your task is to analyse the 49 data files, summarise the
data contained therein, and present them in a report that will illustrate which genes and
mutations the company should focus their efforts on.
Each mutation experiment file will contain the following data in a tab-separated format:
• Gene name
• Wild-type gene DNA sequence including promoter and coding region.
• Mutant DNA gene sequence including promoter and coding region.
• Normalised cell viability – expressed as a percentage for the original and mutant
gene in 3 replicates.
• Normalised mRNA expression level measured by qRT-PCR for the original and
mutant gene in 3 replicates.
• Normalised protein expression level measured by a protein array for the original
and mutant gene in 3 replicates.
The promoter region for each gene will be the first 1000 nucleotides of the wildtype
sequence – the mutation may appear in the promoter region

-->can write it as word or wind down (notebook) 

Example graph. The ‘Mutation.Class’ is derived from the data (see above). Note the
different types of scales on the boxplot and scatter plot. Your plots do not need to be
identical, but they should show at least multi-panel plot like this, with a boxplot, scatter
plot and either histogram or kernel density plot. The graph(s) should be used to
illustrate conclusions, i.e. which gene mutants should be prioritised

-> can use AI but must acknowledge it in the assignment: ChatGPT, Claude...


3 figures -> one has to be a 3 multi panel
introduction

results and discussion are main part 

... no need to go to through academic literature
